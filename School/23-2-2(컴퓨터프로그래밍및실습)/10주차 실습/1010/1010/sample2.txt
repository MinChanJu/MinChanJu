A rival to OpenAI - Anthropic - also just reportedly closed a sizable subleasing deal. 
Its plan: to take over the entire 250,000-square-foot building in downtown San Francisco that was previously Slack's headquarters.
Salesforce, which acquired Slack in 2021, is an investor in Anthropic. 
Meanwhile, Pear VC co-founder Pejman Nozad wrote one of the first small checks to Dropbox when he was still relatively new to the U.S. from Iran and selling Persian rugs to Silicon Valley bigwigs.
