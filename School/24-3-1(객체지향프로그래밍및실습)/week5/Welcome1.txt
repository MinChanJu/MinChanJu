public class Welcome1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
	}
}


A) What package is required to successfully print a string such as the above one? Does the
code run as it is without the required package? Why does it/does it not run?

ans : It runs well without package. Because to print a string using System.out.println(), no specific package is required.

B) We have not defined a package under which the file containing the above source code is
stored in. Where is it placed under such a case?

ans : If a package is not defined for the file containing the source code, it is placed in the default package.

C) The program is without the special constructor method, yet it can run, which means an
object is created in memory. How is this so?

ans : In Java, if a class does not contain any constructors, the compiler automatically provides a default constructor with no parameters.

D) Change the name of the file you have assigned to the source code, and try running it. Does
the code run anymore? Why or why not?

ans : Since the class is public, the file name should be specified the same.
